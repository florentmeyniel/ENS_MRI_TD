# ENS_MRI_TD

This repository contains the material of the course on MRI
- the python notebook "TD_MRI_anatomy.ipynb". We will run it on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)]([https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/florentmeyniel/cogmaster_neuro102/HEAD?labpath=TD_MRI.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fflorentmeyniel%2FENS_MRI_TD/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FTD_MRI_anatomy.ipynb))
(if there are issues with Binder, we can run it on [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/florentmeyniel/ENS_MRI_TD/blob/main/TD_MRI_anatomy.ipynb), which requires to log in with a google account)
